In each school folder there is a ods file, including the data for the event, what event it was (1: Snowday, 2: 2hr Delay, 3: Early Closing), and the latitude and longitude of the school. The addDays.py file takes that file and outputs the csv file, which adds randomly selected regular days ("0" days) and adds them to the data.

In the total folder there is each of the school's csv file and the combination of all of them, combinedData.csv
